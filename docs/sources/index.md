# Data Sources

This section provides documentation for the data sources integrated with Ingestify.

Ingestify supports multiple data providers for sports analytics data. Each source has its own configuration and usage patterns.

## Built-in Sources

- [StatsBomb](statsbomb.md) - Access data from the StatsBomb API
- [StatsBomb GitHub](./statsbomb_github.md) - Access open data from StatsBomb's GitHub repository

## Creating Custom Sources

You can create custom sources by extending the `Source` class. See the [API Reference](../api_reference.md) for details on implementing custom sources.
